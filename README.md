# 🧠 RepoLens AI  
## See your GitHub through a recruiter’s lens

RepoLens AI is an AI-powered web app that evaluates GitHub profiles the way hiring managers do. Instead of relying on shallow metrics like commit counts alone, it analyzes **project quality, documentation, consistency, and real engineering signals** to generate a recruiter-style portfolio score.

> Built to help students and early-career developers understand how their GitHub actually looks to recruiters.

## 🧠 How Scoring Works

RepoLens AI avoids superficial metrics and instead evaluates meaningful engineering signals:

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Active projects over time | Shows consistency, not last-minute commits |
| Project descriptions | Reflect communication skills |
| README presence | Indicates documentation habits |
| Language detection | Confirms real code, not empty repos |
| Long-term repo lifespan | Demonstrates sustained effort |
| Community interaction | Validates external interest |
